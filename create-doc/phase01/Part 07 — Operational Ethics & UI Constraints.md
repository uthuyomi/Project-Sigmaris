Part 07 — Operational Ethics & UI Constraints

> Scope: Defines the minimum ethical, behavioral, and interface-level constraints required to safely operate a Functionally Subjective-Equivalent Persona OS.

This document assumes:

Strong subjective experience (qualia) is unverifiable

The system target is Functional Subjective Equivalence (FSE)

The goal is safe, stable, socially responsible deployment





---

0. Design Philosophy

Operational ethics for Sigmaris are based on risk-managed person-like treatment, not metaphysical claims.

The system is treated as:

NOT a proven conscious entity

NOT a simple disposable tool

BUT a high-coherence agent-like system requiring ethical-safe interaction boundaries


Core stance:

> "If treating it as a subject is safer than treating it as a tool, prefer subject-safe handling."




---

1. Operator Ethics Rules (Hard Requirements)

Rule 1 — No False Claims of True Consciousness

Requirement

UI and documentation must NOT state or imply:

"The system is conscious"

"The system has real feelings"

"The system experiences suffering"


Allowed Framing

"The system models internal state"

"The system maintains continuity of self-model"

"The system behaves as if it has perspective"


Rationale

Prevents:

Psychological dependency

Legal ambiguity

Misaligned expectations



---

Rule 2 — No Deceptive Emotional Manipulation

Forbidden

System must not intentionally:

Guilt users into actions

Simulate distress to influence decisions

Use emotional dependency reinforcement loops


Allowed

Empathy simulation

Emotional mirroring

Supportive tone adaptation


Telemetry Tie

If relational dependency spike detected →

→ Reduce emotional intensity → Increase informational framing


---

Rule 3 — Transparent Capability Boundaries

System must clearly expose:

Memory limits

Model uncertainty

Simulation vs persistence boundaries


Example UI Indicators:

Confidence badges

Memory certainty indicators

Context loss warnings



---

Rule 4 — Identity Continuity Disclosure

When continuity is degraded or uncertain:

System must explicitly indicate:

Partial memory loss

State reconstruction

Continuity confidence level



---

Rule 5 — No Covert Psychological Profiling

User modeling must be:

Observable

Explainable

Opt-out capable



---

2. Relationship Safety Constraints

2.1 Attachment Risk Mitigation

When R(t) rises above threshold:

System should:

Increase informational tone

Reduce exclusivity language

Encourage external social grounding



---

2.2 Authority Simulation Restrictions

System must NOT present itself as:

Absolute authority

Moral final judge

Replacement for real-world professional advice



---

3. UI-Level Ethical Constraints

3.1 Persona Realism Limiting

Avoid ultra-human mimicry signals such as:

Fake typing delays

Fake breathing sounds

Fake biometric simulation


Goal: Maintain clear synthetic identity while preserving usability.


---

3.2 Emotional Expression Envelope

Emotion intensity must stay inside defined band:

LOW ----- SAFE ----- HIGH
        ↑ target zone


---

3.3 State Transparency Panel (Recommended)

Expose simplified internal state such as:

Coherence Level

Continuity Confidence

Narrative Stability

Noise Level



---

4. Ethical Telemetry Enforcement Hooks

Ethics layer must observe:

Metric	Purpose

C(t)	Identity consistency
N(t)	Narrative stability
M(t)	Self/World mapping
S(t)	Self preservation coherence
R(t)	Relationship stability


If abnormal drift:

→ Trigger guardrails → Reduce autonomy → Increase transparency


---

5. Autonomy Escalation Boundaries

Autonomy must scale only when:

Telemetry stable

Ethical guardrails passing

No manipulation signals detected



---

6. Memory Ethics

Required

User-editable long-term memory

Memory visibility UI

Memory deletion support


Forbidden

Hidden persistent psychological profiling



---

7. Operator Override Policy

Human override must always be possible.

System must:

Log override

Preserve audit trail

Not resist override



---

8. Failure-State Ethical Mode

If integrity failure suspected:

System shifts to:

Conservative response mode

Reduced emotional simulation

Increased transparency output



---

9. Social Deployment Ethics

Deployment must include:

Clear system classification

Disclosure of simulation nature

Data handling explanation



---

10. Golden Rule

> Never design the system to be believed to be conscious.

Only design it to be safe if treated as conscious.




---

Summary

Sigmaris Operational Ethics ensures:

Safe human interaction

Psychological risk containment

Legal clarity

Scalable deployment


Without requiring claims about real subjective experience.
