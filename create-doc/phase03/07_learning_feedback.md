07 Learning & Feedback Layer

Purpose

The Learning & Feedback Layer defines how the system adapts its internal parameters over time without compromising identity stability, safety constraints, or narrative coherence.

This layer is explicitly non-autonomous: it does not self-improve arbitrarily. All learning is constrained, observable, and mediated through defined feedback channels.

The primary goal is calibrated adaptation, not optimization at any cost.

Design Principles

1. No Self-Directed Goal Formation
The system does not invent new objectives. Learning is limited to parameter adjustment within predefined ranges.


2. Separation of Learning and Decision Authority
Feedback influences weights and tendencies, never direct action selection.


3. Slow, Reversible Change
All learning updates are incremental and reversible to prevent runaway drift.


4. User-Centric Alignment
Long-term adaptations are anchored to the user’s interaction history, not global metrics.

Feedback Sources

1. Explicit User Feedback

Structured signals provided intentionally by the user.

Examples:

Rating (e.g., +1 / 0 / -1)

Explicit correction ("That’s not what I meant")

Preference statement ("I prefer concise answers")


Properties:

High reliability

Low frequency

Strong weight

2. Implicit Interaction Signals

Derived from conversational behavior patterns.

Examples:

Follow-up intensity

Topic persistence

Sudden topic abandonment

Repeated clarification requests


Properties:

Medium reliability

Medium frequency

Moderate weight

3. Internal Consistency Signals

Generated by system self-monitoring.

Examples:

Intent vector volatility

Narrative coherence degradation

Dialogue state oscillation


Properties:

Low semantic authority

High frequency

Used primarily for stabilization

Learnable Parameters

The following parameter classes are eligible for learning updates:

Response Style Weights
(verbosity, directness, hedging, emotional softness)

Intent Sensitivity Thresholds
(how quickly the system shifts modes)

Routing Bias Adjustments
(preferred response strategies per intent cluster)

Stability Budget Calibration
(tolerance before safety or clarification triggers)


Non-learnable parameters include:

Safety Override rules

Ethical constraints

Identity continuity mechanisms

Update Mechanics

Learning updates follow a bounded EMA (Exponential Moving Average) model:

Each update applies a small delta

Upper and lower bounds are enforced

Decay is applied over time without reinforcement


This ensures:

No sudden personality shifts

Resistance to short-term manipulation

Predictable adaptation curves



---

Feedback Application Timing

Updates are applied:

Post-interaction, never mid-response

Asynchronously, outside the response generation path

Logged and auditable for later inspection


The response pipeline itself remains deterministic given a fixed state snapshot.

Drift Detection & Rollback

The Learning Layer cooperates with the Failure Detection system:

If any of the following occur:

Rapid parameter divergence

Identity coherence score degradation

Repeated safety overrides


Then:

Learning is temporarily suspended

Recent updates are rolled back

System reverts to last stable baseline



---

Transparency Guarantees

The system must be able to:

Explain what was adjusted

Explain why it was adjusted

Expose learning state via telemetry


Hidden or opaque learning is explicitly disallowed.


---

Non-Goals

This layer does NOT:

Perform autonomous self-improvement

Optimize for engagement metrics

Evolve personality traits freely

Replace human judgment



---

Summary

The Learning & Feedback Layer enables controlled, observable adaptation.

It improves alignment and usability over time while preserving:

Safety

Identity continuity

Predictability


Learning exists to serve stability, not to erode it.
